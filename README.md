## :seedling: What is Power-Plant
Power-Plant is a project on my indoor plant, a Lemon balm. Months ago, I wanted to irrigate automatically my flowers on my balcony. But I realize that my power supply can't be all the time outside. So I decided to put one of my plants inside, to make my IoT project.
